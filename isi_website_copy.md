### Problem → Solution → Impact
Healthcare today is fragmented. Data lives in silos, transitions break down, and manual processes overwhelm both professionals and families. The result is lost time, lost outcomes, and a system too complex for the people it’s meant to serve.

ISI is changing this. Oria instantly processes medical, therapy, and academic records to produce summaries, recommendations, and personalized care plans. Providers gain real-time insights. Families gain clarity. Communities gain better outcomes.
