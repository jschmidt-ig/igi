- Easy revocation of access when no longer needed

### 3. Care Coordination
MyEMR facilitates better communication:
- Providers can update records in real-time
- Families stay informed about care decisions
- Treatment plans remain synchronized across providers
- Progress tracking across all care touchpoints
