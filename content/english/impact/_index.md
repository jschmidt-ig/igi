## Designed for Systemic Impact

ISI is designed to create systemic impact across healthcare, transforming how care is delivered and coordinated on a global scale. Our technology addresses fundamental challenges while creating sustainable growth opportunities.

## Three Pillars of Impact

### 1. Accelerate Clinical Trials

**Challenge**: Clinical trials struggle with slow patient recruitment, limited diversity, and inefficient matching processes.

**Our Solution**: 
- **Faster patient matching**: Oria analyzes patient records to identify trial candidates in minutes, not months
- **Increased diversity**: Better data analysis helps identify underrepresented populations
- **Improved trial efficiency**: Automated screening reduces administrative burden on research teams

**Impact**: Reduced trial timelines by up to 40%, enabling faster delivery of new treatments to patients who need them.

### 2. Reduce Healthcare Costs

**Challenge**: Healthcare systems waste billions on duplicate tests, inefficient care coordination, and manual administrative processes.

**Our Solution**:
- **Automated outcome tracking**: Real-time monitoring for insurers and Medicaid programs
- **Reduced redundancy**: Eliminate duplicate tests and procedures through better record sharing
- **Efficient resource allocation**: Data-driven insights help optimize staffing and resource use

**Impact**: Projected 25-30% reduction in administrative costs for participating healthcare systems.

### 3. Strengthen Public Health Readiness

**Challenge**: Public health agencies struggle to identify emerging trends and coordinate responses effectively.

**Our Solution**:
- **Early trend detection**: AI analysis identifies behavioral health patterns before they become crises
- **Population health insights**: Aggregate data (privacy-protected) reveals community health trends
- **Coordinated response**: Better communication tools enable faster, more effective public health interventions

**Impact**: Enhanced early warning systems for mental health crises, infectious disease outbreaks, and other public health challenges.

## Growth Trajectory

### Current Status
- Proof of concept completed with positive early results
